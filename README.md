## ⚡ Recent Projects

- Dawn Ryan. This is a portfolio and services website for freelance copyeditor and proofreader Dawn Ryan. She's a long-time professional in the publishing industry, and wanted specifically to highlight not only the work she's accomplished, but the variety of services she can offer. I explored many new technologies when developing this website to accomplish the desires of my client, specifically Framer Motion. I love exploring new technologies, and will continue to do so as a client's needs change!
- AlgoRhythm. This application is a Multiple Choice study-guide for Algorhithms, Data Structures, and basic questions about popular languages like JavaScript and Python as well as popular frameworks like React and NodeJs. 
- Drop of CSS. This is a color palette and element generating tool. The idea came from simply wanting to provide developers and freelancers with a simple tool to create a beautiful website with elements they can preview and download. So much of designing a beautiful website comes from picking pleasing colors and combining them seamlessly with component elements, and we aimed to make that as simple as possible!
